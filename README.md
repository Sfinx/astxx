- Removed brain dead cmake
- Ported to the new boost
- Added simple example

---------

The goal of Astxx is to provide a fully functional and easy to use C++ wrapper 
for Asterisk enabling developers to write Asterisk related software using the 
full range of what C++ has to offer.  This includes AGI scripts, accessing the 
Manager API, writing ExternalIVR scripts, writing IAX clients, and writing 
Asterisk modules.

Currently Astxx supports the AGI API and the Manager API.
